# splay-game-platform-db
This project is a basic database model for a game platform similar to Steam, developed for the Database Management Systems course. The database structure was designed to manage games, users, and purchases. Additionally, a simple interface was created using Node.js and HTML to visualize database operations. 

## Notes
This project was developed as the final project for the Database Management Systems course in the first semester of my 2nd year at Sakarya University.
